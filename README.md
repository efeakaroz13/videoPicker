# Video Picker
A project for you to select your videos without the affect of YouTube homepage AI. Enter your subscriptions or interest topics and let the software choose you the videos for you.


## Idea
I personally think that youtube is a great platform for learning. It has handful of learning content. But alongside to this, it is 50-60% entertainement videos or videos that does not make us learn anything. Instead of mindlessly picking videos, I decided that a software can decide randomly what will I watch that day and I have a 3 video limit a day. For increasing attention span, videos should be more than 10 minutes. It is still in development but I will publish it soon.

## TO-DO
 - Create the base structre for adding custom channels
 - Write the program to randomly select videos
 - Scrape the video ID and download it with pytube
 - run this with an automation script
 - Web interface(as a content consumption management software) - Not Sure
 - Notes for video and list what you have learned.
## For easy installation:
Probably will turn it into a linux deb package
